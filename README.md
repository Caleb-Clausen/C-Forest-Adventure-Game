This program allows the user to go through a basic 2d Windows console game by going on an adventure with text at its for front. 
It focuses on program control flow by creating different scenes through switching statements.
The code uses ascii text used as the graphical portion and user input to steer the game. 
This and utilizing stream readers to generate map files based off text allows for character movement on a console map. 
Below are examples of different scenes in the game.
